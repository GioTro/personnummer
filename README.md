# personnummer

Validation of Swedish Social Security Numbers.
This exact implementation is not intended to be used as is. It just validates if the sequence is a well-formed Swedish social security number as specified by Skatteverket.

All test cases are provided by Skatteverket and do not correspond to a real person.
